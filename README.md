# PyTorch-Mnist-Visualiser

A simple visuliser where you can draw an image of a number and the program will predict what number it is.

Contains the code required to train your own model, though I haven't tested that it works on another machine.

This program runs on Python (3.8.5 used in testing), Pytorch (1.7.1 cuda 11.0), Pygame (2.0.1), and MLxtend (0.18.0)
